<content>Dave Pearce is a British dance DJ and record producer, who has played gigs across the UK and the world, although he is perhaps best known for his work in radio. He currently works for the BBC 6 Music. He formerly presented the long-running Dance Anthems show on BBC Radio 1, which was for most of its time aired on early Sunday evenings before moving to late Friday nights in its final year. His last show on BBC Radio 1 was broadcast on Friday 26 September 2008. He has brought several sayings into the world of dance including &quot;putting on your trance trousers&quot; when he plays a trance record, &quot;roll another fat one&quot; meaning to play another great record. He is also known for his cry of &quot;Oi Oi!&quot; from the DJ booth. Pearce now broadcasts Dance Anthems on BBC 6 Music.&#10;&#10;Pearce joined BBC Radio 1 in April 1995, taking over the weekday early-breakfast show from Bruno Brookes. He took over the weekend mid-morning slot in October the same year. February 1997 saw Pearce taking over weekend breakfast and on October 13 the same year, he went on to present the drivetime show from Kevin Greening, who had taken over Breakfast, alongside Zoe Ball. In addition to drivetime, Pearce took over the Dance Anthems show on Sunday evenings. In October 1998 Chris Moyles took over the drivetime show and Pearce began presenting a Monday - Thursday evening show from 6-8pm entitled The Late Drive. This show was axed in 2004.&#10;&#10;Dave Celebrated 10 years of dance anthems in August 2007. The 5 hour special Dance Anthems show included input from Pete Tong, Judge Jules and a phone in from Tiesto.&#10;&#10;His first show on 6 Music was broadcast on Sunday 5 October 2008 from 8pm to 10pm, playing dance music from the last 30 years. Noel Gallagher was the first celebrity guest to pick his favourite dance anthem, which was &quot;Strings of Life&quot; by Rhythim is Rhythim. Pearce has also presented occasional shows on BBC Radio 2.&#10;&#10;In late 2008 Dave Pearce launched a weekly podcast - Trancecast - which focuses on his interest in trance. It features upfront tracks as well as a weekly guest mix. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Pearce&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.
