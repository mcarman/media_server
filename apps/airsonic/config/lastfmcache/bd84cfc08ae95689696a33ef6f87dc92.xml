<content>Gilla was discovered by German producer Frank Farian who got her signed to Hansa Records in 1974. After an unsuccessful German cover version &quot;Mir ist kein Weg zu weit&quot; of Marcella Bella&apos;s Italian hit single &quot;Nessuno mai&quot;, Farian had her record a German disco version of La Belle&apos;s &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;. Despite being a modest hit (#24), it caused some attention of being the first German record to feature such explicit lyrics as &quot;Willst du mit mir schlafen gehn?&quot; (Do You Want to Sleep With Me) (1975). It was followed later in the year with &quot;Tu es&quot; (also recorded in English as &quot;Why Don&apos;t You Do It&quot;) which became Gilla&apos;s biggest hit, peaking at #10 in the German charts and giving Farian a commercial breakthrough as a producer. Gilla&apos;s debut LP, featuring a mix of disco, pop and schlager tracks, was released shortly after.&#10;In the summer of 1976, Gilla followed with &quot;Ich brenne&quot; (I&apos;m Burning), once again also recorded in English as &quot;Help Help&quot;. It was a Dutch hit single but fared less well in Germany. Farian remixed the track with his own vocals for inclusion on Boney M.&apos;s Take the Heat Off Me to replace &quot;Baby Do You Wanna Bump&quot; in some territories. In early 1977, Gilla&apos;s second album Zieh mich aus (Undress Me) was released. Despite featuring German versions of Boney M.&apos;s hit single &quot;Sunny&quot; and &quot;No Woman No Cry&quot;, it fared poorly. Interestingly, the album also included the German version of a future hit for Boney M., &quot;Belfast&quot; which was originally written years earlier for Boney M. member Marcia Barrett.&#10;Gilla&apos;s first international album was released in the summer of 1977. Entitled Help Help, it featured her previous English recordings like &quot;Why Don&apos;t You Do It&quot; and &quot;Help Help&quot; + their B-sides, as well as English versions of songs from Zieh mich aus. &quot;Gentlemen Callers not Allowed&quot; (&quot;Herrn-Besuche nicht erlaubt&quot;) was released as a single and promoted with Boney M.&apos;s charismatic male dancer Bobby Farrell on a few TV shows but it was still only a minor success.&#10;&#10;&#10;Gilla&apos;s 1978 album Bend Me, Shape Me&#10;In January 1978, Gilla released a disco-rock cover of The American Breed&apos;s &quot;Bend Me, Shape Me&quot;. The single was a #11 hit in Switzerland and it was decided to repackage the Help Help album with the inclusion of the new track and its B-side &quot;The River Sings&quot; (&quot;Der Strom der Zeit&quot;) in May, entitled Bend Me, Shape Me. Once again, it was only a minor seller. Singer Bruce Low released a big-selling German cover of Boney M.&apos;s mega-hit &quot;Rivers of Babylon&quot; so Farian decided to have Gilla record a German cover of the follow-up single &quot;Rasputin&quot;. Released in November 1978, it was a flop and not even included on the following compilation Star Discothek a few months later.&#10;Trying to repeat the success of &quot;Bend Me, Shape Me&quot;, Gilla and her fianc√© and co-producer Helmut Rulofs (who was also a recording artist under the name Chris Denning) released another disco-rock cover of The Animals&apos;s &quot;We Gotta Get Out of This Place&quot; in March 1979. In 1980, her second English language album Cool Rock&apos;n Roll was released including the title track single and &quot;Go Down Mainstreet&quot;. Gilla and Rulofs, however, found bigger success when Farian recorded one of their songs with Boney M. &quot;I See a Boat on the River&quot; being a German Top 10 hit and a European hit single from the million-selling The Magic of Boney M. - 20 Golden Hits, Gilla credited as G. Winger (Winger being an abbreviation of her surname Wuchinger). In October 1981, Gilla&apos;s final single &quot;Cigarillo&quot; backed with a cover of &quot;Friday on My Mind&quot; was released before she retired from the music business. She made a brief return with Rulofs as the duo Sweet Mix in 1982 but their single &quot;Susan Don&apos;t Cry for Me&quot; came and went without notice. They also contributed the track &quot;Video&quot; for Precious Wilson&apos;s album All Coloured in Love that year.&#10;Being largely forgotten in Europe today, Gilla has in recent years performed regularly in Russia where her records are enjoying considerable popularity. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Gilla&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.
