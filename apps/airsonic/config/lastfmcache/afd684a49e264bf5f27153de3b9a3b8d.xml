<summary>There are four bands named Fancy.  The most famous is Manfred Alois Segieth or Manfred Aulhausen. He started his career back in 1984 with his two successful singles Slice Me Nice and Chinese Eyes. In 1985 another hit song Bolero infected European countries uncontrollably (it was a top song in Spain for almost six months). For most of the next year (1986) Fancy was on the road, performing in European as well as US dance clubs. He really became famous with his 1987 album Flames Of Love. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Fancy&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;</summary>
<content>There are four bands named Fancy.  The most famous is Manfred Alois Segieth or Manfred Aulhausen. He started his career back in 1984 with his two successful singles Slice Me Nice and Chinese Eyes. In 1985 another hit song Bolero infected European countries uncontrollably (it was a top song in Spain for almost six months). For most of the next year (1986) Fancy was on the road, performing in European as well as US dance clubs. He really became famous with his 1987 album Flames Of Love. The title track captivated most of the Europe and also showed that Fancy knew what his audience wanted - quality, emotion filled, danceable songs. Two more albums followed in the same musical style and, not surprisingly, Fancy had number of hits with songs such as When Guardian Angels Cry and Angel Eyes. The next couple of albums took a more current EuroDance style direction (one of them was actually heavily based on rap), but now and again one or two tracks on his albums still serves as a reminder of the &apos;80s hits. Fancy is still producing and writing tracks for other artists as well. Fancy is appearantly a very quiet and private person but gives all he has when producing and performing. &#10;&#10;Fancy made a comeback in 1998 with the remix of his biggest hit Flames Of Love. It didn&apos;t take long to captivate audiences around Europe once again. That year Fancy released Hit Party with remixes of his old hits and some new compositions. Only a year later another album D.I.S.C.O. was released and received very good reviews from the fans since most songs were based on an old Fancy formula which made him a star in the &apos;80s. Then came the album Locomotion in 2001.&#10;&#10;The second Fancy (http://myspace.com/welovefancy) is a flamboyant three-piece outfit from the notorious riot zones in the working-class suburbs of Paris. &#10;Mixing AC/DC and T-Rex with the glitter ball sparkle of disco, Fancy comes armed with loads of make-up, feather boas, killer tunes at the ready, and a mountain of glowing press in France - including the &quot;Most Entertaining Group&quot; award from the French newspaper Liberation. Onstage, Fancy has supported MC5, TV on the Radio, Daft Punk and The Rapture.&#10;FANCY also co-wrote the recent Justice hit ‘D.A.N.C.E.’.&#10;“Above all, we’re about making love”, says their singer and resident rock god/dess Jessie Chaton.&#10;&#10;The third Fancy is a British white funk band of the 1970&apos;s most famous for their cover of the Trogg&apos;s &quot;Wild Thing,&quot; a single which went gold in the U.S.  Former Penthouse pet Helen Court sang steamily, Rick Fenwick ex-of the Spencer Davis Group played guitar, Mo Foster bass, Henry Spinetti drums and Alan Hawkshaw keyboards.  Fancy released several subsequent albums replacing Court with Annie Cavanaugh from the cast of Hair and Jesus Christ Superstar, but failed to regain the same success.&#10;&#10;The fourth Fancy is a San Jose, CA based synth pop band that formed immediately after the dissolution of Volvox. Fancy eventually evolved into the solo project of Proton Pigeon. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Fancy&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.
